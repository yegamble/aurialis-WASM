**Single-Binary Go 1.26 + Next.js 16 + WebAssembly (WASM) Audio Mastering Workstation**

Based on [Aurialis](https://aurialis.yosefgamble.com/) ([`yegamble/Aurialis`](https://github.com/yegamble/Aurialis)) and the warm editorial redesign specification in [`docs/design/aurialis-redesign.md`](docs/design/aurialis-redesign.md).

## Current behavior and limits

This is an unfinished workstation undergoing corrective recovery. [The audit](docs/reviews/2026-10-21-war-room-audit.md) records the reproduced failures; [the task tracker](docs/tasks.md) separates implemented behavior from outstanding product requirements. The corrective subset is locally verified and **open — awaiting merge**; full-product delivery, owner approval and remote PR checks remain outstanding.

- The production library starts empty. Import your own PCM WAV; legacy example projects and fabricated analysis/stem results are discarded during migration. The Go server validates and reconstructs audio before it is stored in IndexedDB. Project metadata/settings use localStorage, with an in-memory audio fallback and warning when persistent storage fails.
- Advanced mode offers independent input, five-band EQ, compressor, saturation, stereo and sample-limiter controls. Render preview processes the source through the shared Go WASM engine. Export processes the current settings through native Go, preserving sample rate/frame count in 16/24-bit PCM or 32-bit float WAV.
- Simple mode explicitly measures processed output and adjusts input gain toward its selected loudness target. It reports a failure when the available gain/ceiling constraints cannot reach the target. Advanced rendering never adds hidden target gain. The five profile presets apply static settings; musical section analysis, automation and AI repair remain unavailable.
- A/B comparison uses RMS-based attenuation of the louder buffer, with playback position and monitor level preserved across switches. RMS matching is not an integrated-loudness certification.
- Albums render actual per-track 24-bit WAV artifacts for download while preserving the original uploads. The browser output cache is bounded; broader album consistency and batch recovery requirements remain open. Reference direction blends another project's EQ settings with effective low-band/width options; it does not analyze or match recorded reference spectra.
- Release diagnostics measure actual rendered output with native loudness, reconstructed-peak, sample-peak, crest and correlation meters. Streaming, Dynamic and Spoken word are working targets, not platform delivery certification. Smart Split identifies validated instrument separation as unavailable; its old timer-driven success path is removed.

Imports are bounded to **128 MiB plus the 44-byte canonical WAV header** and **16,777,216 decoded frames** (about 5 min 50 s at 48 kHz or 2 min 55 s at 96 kHz; byte limits can be stricter). The multipart request ceiling is 129 MiB, including canonical float WAV and form overhead. One expensive audio request runs at a time; busy requests return a retryable response. Album output cache is limited to 128 MiB total and lasts only while its page remains open; changing the sequence or processing settings invalidates the downloads. These are finite workstation limits, not unlimited batch capacity.

Continuous AudioWorklet/SharedArrayBuffer processing, validated hardware fidelity, trained separation, source-derived AI analysis and certified true-peak limiting remain open. The native binary embeds the frontend, WASM and matching Go browser runtime. Fonts are self-hosted.

## Quickstart & Single-Binary Build

Use Node `26.12.0`, `pnpm@10.33.0`, Go `1.26.10`, Next.js 16 and React 19, as pinned by this repository. Dependency installation uses pnpm only.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v26.12.0/bin:$PATH"
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build:binary
pnpm run test:binary
./aurialis -addr 127.0.0.1:8080 -workers 4
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). `build:binary` compiles the browser WASM module, copies Go's matching `wasm_exec.js`, builds and synchronizes the static frontend, then builds the host. `pnpm start` runs the built `./aurialis` executable. `test:binary` starts that executable from an empty temporary directory and checks embedded assets and API behavior. A plain `go build` does not rebuild frontend assets.

For integrated local development, run `pnpm dev` and open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000). This command rebuilds and serves the same Go application, including its APIs and isolation headers. Restart it after source changes; it does not provide hot reload. Running Next.js by itself does not provide the Go processing API.

| Flag | Default | Environment override | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-addr` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | `AURIALIS_ADDR`, then `PORT` | HTTP listen address; environment takes precedence over flag. A numeric `PORT` uses loopback; non-loopback addresses are rejected. |
| `-workers` | `0` (auto) | — | Worker count; see current bounds in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). |
| `-max-upload-bytes` | 129 MiB | `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES_OVERRIDE` | Multipart request body ceiling, including fields and boundaries; overrides can lower the hard 129 MiB cap. This does not increase the browser's 128 MiB plus 44-byte file limit. |

## Multi-Model War Room (`war-room` & `war-room-loop`)

This repository ships an 11-seat adversarial War Room configured to run across **Gemini Argon (Google Antigravity / Gemini CLI)**, **Claude Code**, and **OpenAI Codex**:

### Running the War Room

```text
# Review & rule on a specific feature or CI/CD pipeline (no code edits):
/war-room feature=deep-mastering
/war-room feature=smart-split
/war-room ci-cd

# Run the pessimistic implementation & scrutiny loop until 100% verified:
/war-room-loop feature=wasm-dsp max-iterations=4
/war-room-loop ci-cd
/war-room-loop all max-iterations=4 merge=owner
```

After editing any canonical agent in `.claude/agents/aurialis-*.md`, synchronize the Gemini Argon / Antigravity and OpenAI Codex agent definitions via:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-agents.py
```

## Fail-Fast Quality Gates

Always ensure Node `26.12.0` (`$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v26.12.0/bin`) and Go `1.26.10` are on `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v26.12.0/bin:$PATH"

# 1. Go & WASM Gate (.golangci.yml v2: staticcheck all, revive, gosec, nakedret, misspell, dupword)
"$(go env GOROOT)/bin/gofmt" -l cmd internal wasm
go mod verify
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run ./...
identypo ./...
govulncheck ./...
go test -race -count=1 ./...
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -trimpath -o public/wasm/aurialis-dsp.wasm ./wasm/dsp

# 2. Next.js 16 / TypeScript & Vitest Gate (pnpm only)
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm run lint
pnpm exec knip
pnpm exec cspell lint "**/*.{ts,tsx,go,md}"
pnpm test
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:wasm
pnpm run test:meters

# 3. Backend API Gate (Newman TS-001..TS-015 + raw cURL 413 & DNS-rebinding probes)
pnpm run test:backend:postman

# 4. Playwright Responsive (320px–1440px), WCAG 2.2 AA axe, Control-Isolation & WAV Export Gate
pnpm exec playwright test

# 5. Multi-Model War Room Agent Sync Gate
python3 scripts/sync-agents.py --check
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Every commit pushed to any branch (`branches: ['**']`) and every pull request triggers [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) with all skip guards removed so all quality gates run unconditionally:
1. **`repo-and-agent-hygiene`** — Enforces `pnpm`-only lockfiles, bans external icon libraries in `src/`, verifies multi-model agent synchronization (`python3 scripts/sync-agents.py --check`), smoke-tests `.claude/hooks/scrutinise.py`, and validates GitHub Actions YAML with `actionlint`.
2. **`go-wasm`** — Runs `gofmt`, `go mod verify`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` v2, `identypo`, `govulncheck`, `go test -race`, and `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm` compilation.
3. **`frontend-quality`** — Runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm run lint`, `knip`, `cspell`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm run build`.
4. **`backend-newman`** — Runs `pnpm run test:backend:postman` executing Newman `TS-001`–`TS-015` and raw `curl` 413 / DNS-rebinding probes against a live single binary.
5. **`playwright-e2e`** — Runs mobile-first responsive (`320px`–`1440px`), axe WCAG 2.2 AA, control-isolation, and WAV export verification.
6. **`ci-passed`** — Unified gate that fails if any upstream job fails or is cancelled.

## Verification status

Gate commands above are requirements, not claims of passing CI. See [`docs/tasks.md`](docs/tasks.md) and [the ledger](.claude/war-room/ledger.md) for current-session execution evidence and open blockers. The earlier blocked vulnerability lookup was superseded by a successful Go 1.26.10 `govulncheck ./...` run reporting no vulnerabilities. Final local results and failed attempts are recorded in the task tracker; remote PR checks and owner merge remain outstanding. A passing browser smoke test does not certify analog hardware fidelity, codec support, platform release compliance or all accessibility interactions.
