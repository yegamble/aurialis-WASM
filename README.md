<!-- cspell:words Embedder trimpath goroutines scrutinise -->

**Single-Binary Go 1.26 + Next.js 16 + WebAssembly (WASM) Audio Mastering Workstation**

Based on [Aurialis](https://aurialis.yosefgamble.com/) ([`yegamble/Aurialis`](https://github.com/yegamble/Aurialis)) and the warm editorial redesign specification in [`docs/design/aurialis-redesign.md`](docs/design/aurialis-redesign.md).

## Current behavior and limits

This branch is an unfinished workstation prototype. The full product vision remains in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`docs/tasks.md`](docs/tasks.md); no feature is verified and merged by this session.

- Upload a WAV file up to 16 MiB. The Go API validates and reconstructs it into canonical PCM before the browser stores its source Blob in IndexedDB. Project metadata and settings use localStorage. If browser storage fails, the session keeps audio in memory and displays a warning.
- Advanced mode exposes independent gain, EQ, compression, saturation, stereo and limiter controls. Use **Render preview** after edits to process the full source through the shared Go WASM engine. A plays the original and B plays the rendered result; stale B playback is disabled until rendered again. Playback supports play/pause, seek and volume.
- Export renders the latest settings from the actual source through the native Go API, preserving source sample rate and frame count. WAV output supports 16/24-bit PCM or 32-bit float. Missing sources require a new upload; exports never substitute a synthetic tone.
- Browser metrics report measured sample peak (dBFS), RMS and crest factor. These are not certified integrated LUFS, true peak or platform compliance results. There is no automatic loudness matching for A/B.
- Simple and Deep mastering, Smart Split, album processing, Reference Match and Release Check display unavailable states. The older backend Deep and stem routes remain experimental heuristics, without trained separation or AI/LLM inference. Their presence does not constitute working product workflows.

The native server embeds the Next.js static export, WASM module and Go browser runtime. Browser preview currently renders a buffer before playback; direct continuous AudioWorklet/SharedArrayBuffer streaming remains open. The DSP implements useful mathematical transformations, but hardware fidelity, anti-aliasing performance and standards-compliant true-peak limiting require further verification.

## Quickstart & Single-Binary Build

Use Node `26.12.0`, `pnpm@10.33.0`, Go `1.26.9`, Next.js 16 and React 19, as pinned by this repository. Dependency installation uses pnpm only.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build:binary
pnpm run test:binary
./aurialis -addr 127.0.0.1:8080 -workers 4
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). `build:binary` compiles the browser WASM module, copies Go's matching `wasm_exec.js`, builds and synchronizes the static frontend, then builds the host. `pnpm start` runs the built `./aurialis` executable. `test:binary` starts that executable from an empty temporary directory and checks embedded assets and API behavior. A plain `go build` does not rebuild frontend assets.

| Flag | Default | Environment override | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-addr` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | `AURIALIS_ADDR`, then `PORT` | HTTP listen address; environment takes precedence over flag. A numeric `PORT` uses loopback; non-loopback addresses are rejected. |
| `-workers` | `0` (auto) | — | Worker count; see current bounds in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). |
| `-max-upload-bytes` | 32 MiB | `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES_OVERRIDE` | Multipart request body ceiling, including fields and boundaries; overrides can lower the hard 32 MiB cap. This does not increase the browser's 16 MiB import limit. |

## Multi-Model War Room (`war-room` & `war-room-loop`)

This repository ships an 11-seat adversarial War Room configured to run across **Gemini Argon (Google Antigravity / Gemini CLI)**, **Claude Code**, and **OpenAI Codex**:

### Running the War Room

```text
# Review & rule on a specific feature or CI/CD pipeline (no code edits):
/war-room feature=deep-mastering
/war-room feature=smart-split
/war-room ci-cd

# Run the pessimistic implementation & scrutiny loop until 100% verified:
/war-room-loop feature=wasm-dsp max-iterations=4
/war-room-loop ci-cd
/war-room-loop all max-iterations=4 merge=owner
```

After editing any canonical agent in `.claude/agents/aurialis-*.md`, synchronize the Gemini Argon / Antigravity and OpenAI Codex agent definitions via:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-agents.py
```

## Fail-Fast Quality Gates

Always ensure Node `26.12.0` (`$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v26.12.0/bin`) and Go `1.26.9` are on `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v26.12.0/bin:$PATH"

# 1. Go & WASM Gate (.golangci.yml v2: staticcheck all, revive, gosec, nakedret, misspell, dupword)
"$(go env GOROOT)/bin/gofmt" -l cmd internal wasm
go mod verify
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run ./...
identypo ./...
govulncheck ./...
go test -race -count=1 ./...
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -trimpath -o public/wasm/aurialis-dsp.wasm ./wasm/dsp

# 2. Next.js 16 / TypeScript & Vitest Gate (pnpm only)
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm run lint
pnpm exec knip
pnpm exec cspell lint "**/*.{ts,tsx,go,md}"
pnpm test
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:wasm
pnpm run test:meters

# 3. Backend API Gate (Newman TS-001..TS-015 + raw cURL 413 & DNS-rebinding probes)
pnpm run test:backend:postman

# 4. Playwright Responsive (320px–1440px), WCAG 2.2 AA axe, Control-Isolation & WAV Export Gate
pnpm exec playwright test

# 5. Multi-Model War Room Agent Sync Gate
python3 scripts/sync-agents.py --check
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Every commit pushed to any branch (`branches: ['**']`) and every pull request triggers [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) with all skip guards removed so all quality gates run unconditionally:
1. **`repo-and-agent-hygiene`** — Enforces `pnpm`-only lockfiles, bans external icon libraries in `src/`, verifies multi-model agent synchronization (`python3 scripts/sync-agents.py --check`), smoke-tests `.claude/hooks/scrutinise.py`, and validates GitHub Actions YAML with `actionlint`.
2. **`go-wasm`** — Runs `gofmt`, `go mod verify`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` v2, `identypo`, `govulncheck`, `go test -race`, and `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm` compilation.
3. **`frontend-quality`** — Runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm run lint`, `knip`, `cspell`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm run build`.
4. **`backend-newman`** — Runs `pnpm run test:backend:postman` executing Newman `TS-001`–`TS-015` and raw `curl` 413 / DNS-rebinding probes against a live single binary.
5. **`playwright-e2e`** — Runs mobile-first responsive (`320px`–`1440px`), axe WCAG 2.2 AA, control-isolation, and WAV export verification.
6. **`ci-passed`** — Unified gate that fails if any upstream job fails or is cancelled.

## Verification status

Gate commands above are requirements, not claims of passing CI. See [`docs/tasks.md`](docs/tasks.md) and [the ledger](.claude/war-room/ledger.md) for current-session execution evidence and open blockers. In this environment the current `govulncheck` attempt is blocked by a forbidden response from `https://vuln.go.dev`; a historical CVE claim in older docs was not revalidated. A passing browser smoke test does not certify analog hardware fidelity, codec support, platform release compliance or all accessibility interactions.
